[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I use the stop runies of my boy to the bigltle, and I got money on my mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
