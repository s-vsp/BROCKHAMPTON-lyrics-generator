[Intro: Joba]
I find myself high in the distance (Ugh)
Find me up, lying in this ditch (Ugh)

And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment

I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't ele
