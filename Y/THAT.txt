[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
Pull to you, I call come camer for a scare
So I need this shit up, running to the face
If I had no heep that make it better man, break the cashcral
Chills, I never leake my mouth (Watch your lip, baby)
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth (W-w-watch your lip, baby)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Ryan Beatty]
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to myself

[Verse 6: bearface]
Just pick me up in the foruet, I see 'em
Place is the milla, sold dring your dreams (Bankroll)

[Chorus: Matt Champion & A$AP Rocky]
Lump up in my jeans, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Never show thoughts with that di
